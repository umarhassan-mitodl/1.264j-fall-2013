## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *1.264J Database, Internet, and Systems Integration Technologies* as it was taught by Dr. George Kocur in Fall 2013.

The course focuses on defining an engineering and business software system, producing a working version quickly, managing the overall process, and becoming very familiar with database and Web technologies that are central to current software systems. The course has no programming, except that students write database queries in SQL; the system is built using a set of tools that do not require software coding.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

The goal is for students to learn to design, implement and manage engineering and business software systems. It’s an engineering course, and students build a system during the term. As part of the course, students learn about project management, software modeling (UML), databases, the Internet and Web, security, and data communications.
